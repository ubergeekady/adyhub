## Who Is A Manager ?

> "A manager is a guide. They take a group of people and say, 'With you, I can make us a success; I can show you the way."
> - Arsene Wenger

The need for control should not be an aspiration or goal for someone hoping to be a manager.

> “It is better to lead from behind and put others in front, especially when you celebrate victory when nice things occur. You take the front line when there is danger. Then people will appreciate your leadership.”
> - Nelson Mandela

A manager is the person who should aspire most to be the inspiration for their team.

> "Managers must inspire people to dream more, do more, be more."
> - Sharad Bajaj

> “Project management can be defined as a way of developing structure in a complex project where the independent variables of time, cost, resources, and human behavior come together.”
> - Rory Burke

Working as a manager is an accomplishment because it reveals a professional’s ability to successfully lead people, oversee multiple business operations, manage stress, and effectively communicate with coworkers. It’s like cooking a pot of soup; different ingredients come together to make it tasty. Chicken soup doesn’t only require chicken. It requires elements such as water, pepper, salt, seasoning cubes, and much more. These ingredients, when brought together, produce a delicious product. A manager must effectively bring diverse resources together to achieve an organizational goal.
