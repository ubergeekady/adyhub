## Introduction

- Book is about software engineering Craftsmanship == writing clean code
- Two aspects of Craftsmanship - knowledge and its application (work)
- Knowledge - principles, patterns, practices and heuristics
- Work - using the knowledge every day when reading lots of code, making mistakes, arguing over it, seeing the price you pay for wrong decisions
- 3 parts of the book - 
  - Part 1 - principles, patterns and best practices of writing good clean code
  - Part 2 - case studies and exercise to use knowledge gathered in part 1
  - Part 3 - summary list of heuristics to detect smelly (bad) code, learnt from part 2
- Insight - just knowing principles is not enough, you will have to use them daily, as an engineer you will have to write and review lots of code and get your code reviewed by senior people and learn from your mistakes.
