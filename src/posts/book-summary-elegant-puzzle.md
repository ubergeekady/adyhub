### Introduction

“There are few things peaceful about managing in rapidly growing companies, but I’ve never found anywhere better to learn and to grow. As I’ve become more experienced, my appreciation for management, and engineering management in particular, has grown, and I’ve come to view the field as a series of elegant, rewarding, and important puzzles. This book is a collection of those puzzles, which I’ve had the good fortune to struggle with and learn from.”
