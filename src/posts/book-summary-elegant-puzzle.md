# Introduction

> “There are few things peaceful about managing in rapidly growing companies, but I’ve never found anywhere better to learn and to grow. As I’ve become more experienced, my appreciation for management, and engineering management in particular, has grown, and I’ve come to view the field as a series of elegant, rewarding, and important puzzles. This book is a collection of those puzzles, which I’ve had the good fortune to struggle with and learn from.”

### 2.1 Sizing Teams

- **Managers should support six to eight engineers.** Managers supporting fewer than four engineers tend to function as TLMs. Managers supporting more than eight or nine engineers typically act as coaches and safety nets for problems.
- **Managers-of-managers should support four to six managers.**
- **On-call rotations want eight engineers.** For production on-call responsibilities, I’ve found that two-tier 24/7 support requires eight engineers.
- **Small teams (fewer than four members) are not teams.** An important property of teams is that they abstract the complexities of the individuals that compose them. Teams with fewer than four individuals are a sufficiently leaky abstraction that they function indistinguishably from individuals. To reason about a small team’s delivery, you’ll have to know about each on-call shift, vacation, and interruption.

### 2.2 Staying on the path to high-performing teams

Should my friend spread hiring equally across the teams in need, or focus hiring on just one or two teams until their needs are fully staffed? That is the question.

- **Four states of a team1**
  - A team is falling behind if each week their backlog is longer than it was the week before.
  - A team is treading water if they’re able to get their critical work done, but are not able to start paying down technical debt or begin major new projects.
  - A team is repaying debt when they’re able to start paying down technical debt, and are beginning to benefit from the debt repayment snowball: each piece of debt you repay leads to more time to repay more debt.
  - A team is innovating when their technical debt is sustainably low, morale is high, and the majority of work is satisfying new user needs.
  - Teams want to climb from falling behind to innovating, while entropy drags them backward. Each state requires a different tact.
- **System fixes and tactical support**
