Today i have taken a decision to re-start my entrepreneurship journey. To build a new company. The company isn't incorporated yet. So it is not a legal entity yet. I haven’t even thought of a name. That is, to serve the society and be a force for good in this world. And to do it at a massive scale.

But why do all this ? Nobody asked me to do it. Why am i doing it then ? I might get a job. But why even get a job ? There are questions more fundamental than that. The most fundamental existential question - why live ? Why not die ? We will try keep thinking about these issues for some other day.

I would say the company should make atleast that much per month immediately to pay for my own labor. That is my lifestyle and responsibilities. A salary - about 2.5 lakhs a month after taxes. And i don’t have much now. Just 844 INR in the personal bank account. I refrain from using the word - “needs”. That is a very low bar. I can survive at - maybe 5000 per month. I don't need much at all. So why do I want more ? I surely do not want to live in the slums. Decent house, clothes etc. cost money. What is the cost of living a middle-class life in a city like Delhi ? Debatable. I am a bachelor (but I do have responsibilities and dependents and EMIs and Debt as well). I have just pulled out the above figure out of thin air. It is not set in stone. Other people can feel free to comment on this.

But we need to quickly move beyond bare survival necessities and me living a good life. Is surviving and living a good life enough ? Yes it is. But, we’d like something more. We'd like to do it at scale. And we’d like to feel good about ourselves and learn new things on the journey. I personally would feel good about myself when i could see myself being useful to the society - specifically by building great technology products which millions of people love. And do that at scale. But a company also needs to be a place where other people who work here are able to grow.

A 1 billion$ valuation is a good point to focus on for now. We will see what to do when we reach there. May be shoot for 10 ? How fast can we get to 1 ? Many people have achieved it in under 18 months. That is a good benchmark. We should try to shoot for it.

What does a billion dollar valuation mean ? It means 100 million$ of revenue with a fast month to month growth. At a slower growth rate, we will need to be at a higher revenue. Can we get there in 18 months ? Great thing to shoot for sure. We will make our projection clearer in the time to come. Heck, i haven’t even decided what our company will be doing yet. We don’t have any products. But we can build products.

While, we sleep over our long term strategy. We need to start generating revenues now so that at least we survive. We are on a survival mode now. What better to sell our services to other people who need it. That would be a great starting point.

Today is my first day at my company's new office. At a co-working space called SupremeWork at 100ft, Road, Chhattarpur, New Delhi. I booked it through the myHQ app. This co-working space has a great ambience. Nobody was around here when i walked in. I took a desk. The manager came in later on and allocated me another seat. The weather today is very nice and pleasant. I got up today morning at 6 and went for a 4 km run. Have been doing this since 5 days now. Last week, I went on a short road trip to Jaipur with my friends. 

I have to work on a viable business plan today and reach out to more people who i think could be potential partners in my journey.

See you tomorrow :)
