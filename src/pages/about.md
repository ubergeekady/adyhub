Hello. I am Aditya Singh. I am a programming geek based out of Delhi. I have been a startup founder once and have completed many web technology projects on multiple languages / frameworks / cloud platforms. I am a tech autodidact and have been on the scene since i was 10.

I have created this blog to share my notes and learnings which might be of use to other enthusiasts.

Thanks.
